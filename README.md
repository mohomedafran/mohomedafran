## 👨‍💻 About Me

Driven by curiosity and a passion for technology, I specialize in crafting seamless user experiences with React JS while exploring the depths of backend development. As a Computer Science undergraduate, I thrive at the intersection of creativity and code—whether that’s designing intuitive UIs, building scalable APIs, or diving into cybersecurity challenges.

I love transforming ideas into real-world solutions and constantly pushing the limits of what I can build and secure.
